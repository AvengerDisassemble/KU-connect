## üìù Detailed Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Service Layer

#### ‚òê Step 1: Create utility/helper functions in professorService.js
**File:** `backend/src/services/professorService.js`  
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `calculateStudentYear(expectedGraduationYear)` function
  - Logic: Compare with current year (2025)
  - Return: 1, 2, 3, 4, or "4+" as string
  - Formula:
    ```javascript
    const yearsUntilGraduation = expectedGraduationYear - currentYear
    if (yearsUntilGraduation <= 0) return "4+"
    if (yearsUntilGraduation === 1) return 4
    if (yearsUntilGraduation === 2) return 3
    if (yearsUntilGraduation === 3) return 2
    if (yearsUntilGraduation >= 4) return 1
    ```

- [ ] Create `calculateQualifiedRate(qualifiedCount, totalCount)` function
  - Return: Percentage (0-100) with 1 decimal place
  - Handle division by zero (return 0)
  - Formula: `(qualifiedCount / totalCount) * 100`

- [ ] Create `determineTrend(percentChange)` function
  - Return: "increasing" | "stable" | "decreasing"
  - Logic:
    - If change > 5%: "increasing"
    - If change < -5%: "decreasing"
    - Otherwise: "stable"

- [ ] Create `getDateRange(timePeriod)` function
  - Input: "last7days" | "last30days" | "last90days" | "all" | custom
  - Return: { startDate, endDate } as Date objects
  - Handle custom date range from params

- [ ] Add JSDoc documentation to all functions

**Validation:**
- All functions are pure (no side effects)
- All edge cases handled (null, undefined, zero)
- Return types match specification

---

#### ‚òê Step 2: Implement getDashboardAnalytics() service function
**File:** `backend/src/services/professorService.js`  
**Estimated Time:** 1.5-2 hours

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up function signature with filters parameter
- [ ] Parse and apply date range filters
- [ ] **Calculate Summary Metrics:**
  - [ ] totalStudents (count all students)
  - [ ] studentsWithApplications (count distinct students with applications)
  - [ ] totalApplications (count all applications)
  - [ ] totalActiveJobs (count jobs where deadline > now)
  - [ ] qualifiedRate (use calculateQualifiedRate helper)

- [ ] **Calculate Application Metrics:**
  - [ ] thisMonth.count (applications in current month)
  - [ ] lastMonth.count (applications in previous month)
  - [ ] thisMonth.percentChange (compare to last month)
  - [ ] thisMonth.trend (use determineTrend helper)
  - [ ] byStatus (group by PENDING/QUALIFIED/REJECTED)
  - [ ] averagePerStudent (total / students with applications)

- [ ] **Calculate Job Metrics:**
  - [ ] activeJobPostings (count active jobs)
  - [ ] thisMonth.newJobs (jobs created this month)
  - [ ] lastMonth.newJobs (jobs created last month)
  - [ ] thisMonth.percentChange
  - [ ] thisMonth.trend
  - [ ] byJobType (group by internship/full-time/part-time/contract)
  - [ ] topCompanies (top 5 by job count and application count)

- [ ] **Calculate Application Trends:**
  - [ ] daily: Last 30 days of application counts and new job counts
  - [ ] monthly: Last 6 months of application counts and new job counts
  - [ ] Group by date/month using Prisma aggregations

- [ ] **Calculate Degree Type Breakdown:**
  - [ ] For each degree type:
    - studentCount
    - applicationCount
    - qualifiedCount
    - qualifiedRate
    - averageGPA (handle null values)

- [ ] **Get Recent Activity:**
  - [ ] Fetch last 10 applications
  - [ ] Include student name, job title, company, timestamp, status
  - [ ] Order by createdAt DESC

- [ ] Apply degreeTypeId filter if provided
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Add JSDoc documentation

**Prisma Queries Needed:**
```javascript
// Summary
prisma.student.count()
prisma.application.count()
prisma.job.count({ where: { application_deadline: { gt: new Date() } } })

// Applications by status
prisma.application.groupBy({ by: ['status'], _count: true })

// Jobs by type with application counts
prisma.job.groupBy({ by: ['jobType'], _count: true })

// Trends
prisma.application.groupBy({ 
  by: ['createdAt'], 
  _count: true,
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'asc' }
})

// Degree breakdown
prisma.degreeType.findMany({
  include: {
    students: {
      include: {
        applications: true
      }
    }
  }
})
```

**Validation:**
- Response matches specification schema exactly
- All calculations are accurate
- Filters work correctly
- Performance is acceptable (< 2 seconds)

---

#### ‚òê Step 3: Implement getStudentList() service function
**File:** `backend/src/services/professorService.js`  
**Estimated Time:** 1-1.5 hours

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up function signature with params object
- [ ] **Parse and validate query parameters:**
  - [ ] degreeTypeId (string)
  - [ ] year (string: "1", "2", "3", "4", "4+")
  - [ ] status (enum: PENDING/QUALIFIED/REJECTED)
  - [ ] hasApplications (boolean)
  - [ ] search (string - search name or email)
  - [ ] sortBy (string: name/applications/qualifiedRate/lastActivity/gpa)
  - [ ] order (string: asc/desc)
  - [ ] page (number, default: 1)
  - [ ] limit (number, default: 20, max: 100)

- [ ] **Build Prisma where clause:**
  - [ ] Filter by degreeTypeId if provided
  - [ ] Filter by year (convert to expectedGraduationYear range)
  - [ ] Filter by search (OR on name/surname/email)
  - [ ] Filter by hasApplications (exists check)
  - [ ] Filter by status (nested application status)

- [ ] **Calculate pagination:**
  - [ ] skip = (page - 1) * limit
  - [ ] take = limit
  - [ ] totalCount query
  - [ ] totalPages = Math.ceil(total / limit)

- [ ] **Fetch students with relations:**
  - [ ] Include user (name, surname, email, verified, phoneNumber, createdAt)
  - [ ] Include degreeType
  - [ ] Include applications (all fields)
  - [ ] Apply where clause, skip, take

- [ ] **Transform each student:**
  - [ ] Calculate year using calculateStudentYear()
  - [ ] Calculate applicationStats:
    - total count
    - count by status (pending/qualified/rejected)
    - qualifiedRate using helper
  - [ ] Determine recentStatus (most recent application status)
  - [ ] Get lastApplicationDate (most recent application.createdAt)
  - [ ] Set hasResume, hasTranscript (check for null)
  - [ ] Format response fields

- [ ] **Handle sorting:**
  - [ ] name: Sort by user.name
  - [ ] applications: Sort by application count (computed)
  - [ ] qualifiedRate: Sort by qualified percentage (computed)
  - [ ] lastActivity: Sort by last application date
  - [ ] gpa: Sort by student.gpa

- [ ] Return paginated response with summary
- [ ] Add JSDoc documentation

**Special Handling:**
- Year filtering requires converting "4+" to expectedGraduationYear <= currentYear
- Sorting by computed fields may require post-query sorting in JavaScript
- Search should be case-insensitive

**Validation:**
- Pagination works correctly
- All filters work individually and combined
- Sorting works for all fields
- Search works for partial matches
- Response matches specification

      user: true,
      degreeType: true,
      applications: {
        include: {
          job: {
            include: {
              hr: true

  - [ ] degreeType (id and name)
  - [ ] currentYear (use calculateStudentYear)
  - [ ] expectedGraduationYear
  - [ ] gpa
  - [ ] hasResume, hasTranscript, hasVerificationDoc (boolean checks)
