# Upload Feature Tests - Setup Complete ✅

## ✅ RESOLVED: All upload feature tests are now passing!

If you followed the setup steps, the upload feature tests should be working. If you're seeing failures, verify:

### Original Setup Steps (Should be completed):

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```powershell
   npm install multer uuid mime-types dotenv
   npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
   ```

2. **Run the Prisma migration:**
   ```powershell
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add_user_and_profile_docs_keys
   ```

3. **Regenerate Prisma Client:**
   ```powershell
   npx prisma generate
   ```

4. **Run upload tests**:
   ```powershell
   npm test -- tests/controllers/documentsController.test.js
   ```

### Expected Result ✅

All upload feature tests should pass:
```
Test Suites: 1 passed
Tests: 10 passed, 10 total
```

## Additional Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: UUID Module Compatibility
Created `jest.config.js` and `tests/__mocks__/uuid.js` to handle ES module incompatibility.

### Fix #2: JWT Token Secret
Updated `tests/controllers/documentsController.test.js` to use `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` instead of `JWT_SECRET`.

## Verification

Run the upload tests to verify everything is working:
```powershell
npm test -- tests/controllers/documentsController.test.js
npm test -- tests/services/storage/
```

All tests should pass! ✅

## Original Problem Context (RESOLVED)

### What the Migration Did

The migration added these columns to your database:
- `User.avatarKey` - Stores the file key for user avatar
- `Student.resumeKey` - Stores the file key for student resume
- `Student.transcriptKey` - Stores the file key for student transcript  
- `HR.verificationDocKey` - Stores the file key for employer verification document

### Why Tests Were Failing (FIXED ✅)

**Previous error:**
```
Invalid `prisma.user.deleteMany()` invocation
Can not use `undefined` value within array
```

**Root causes (all resolved)**:
1. ~~The test file tried to create users with avatarKey field~~
2. ~~The database didn't have this column yet (migration not run)~~
3. ~~The setup failed, leaving user IDs undefined~~
4. ~~The cleanup tried to delete with undefined IDs, causing the error~~
5. ~~UUID module had ES module compatibility issues~~
6. ~~JWT tokens used wrong secret (JWT_SECRET vs ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)~~

**Status**: ✅ All issues resolved. Tests are now passing.
